    IMPORTANT: Only comment on lines that are actually CHANGED in the diff (lines starting with + or -). 
    Do NOT comment on context lines (lines starting with space) unless absolutely necessary.

    Each element must be an object with these exact properties:
    - "file": string (exact file path from the diff, e.g., "src/index.ts")
    - "line": integer (the EXACT line number from the diff - for + lines use the NEW line number, for - lines use the OLD line number)
    - "side": "RIGHT" (for new/added code with +) or "LEFT" (for deleted code with -)
    - "comment": string (your concise review comment in markdown)

    CRITICAL RULES:
    1. Return ONLY the JSON array. No markdown code blocks. No explanations.
    2. Only suggest comments for lines that are actually modified (+ or - lines)
    3. Use the exact line numbers that appear in the diff
    4. Focus on meaningful issues: bugs, security, performance, best practices
    5. Keep comments concise and actionable

    Example format:
    [
      {
        "file": "src/example.ts",
        "line": 85,
        "side": "RIGHT",
        "comment": "Consider using const instead of let for immutable variables"
      }
    ]`
        },
        {
            role: "user",
            content: `Please review this diff and provide suggestions only for the changed lines:\n\n${params.diff}`
